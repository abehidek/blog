This project is meant to be documented from day 1.

~~After searching a little bit, I decided to give Svelte a look, it seems like an interesting JavaScript framework to try out.~~

I might use svelte in another project, however, since it's been times since I've used a JavaScript framework, I decided to use Reactjs since it's the most popular framework nowadays, Also, I'm using nextjs on top of that to render the page in the server side.

However, let me advertise that this isn't necessarily the definitive tool that I will be using in this project.

I'm still thinking about other tools that I can use in this project, probably I will be commiting the project's backend as well.
