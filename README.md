# Abe Hidek's blog

This project is meant to be documented from day 1.
After searching a little bit, I decided to give Svelte a look, it seems like an interesting JavaScript framework to try out.

However, let me advertise that this isn't necessarily the definitive tool that I will be using in this project.

I'm still thinking about other tools that I can use in this project, probably I will be commiting the project's backend as well.
